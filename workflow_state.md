# Workflow State & Rules (STM + Rules + Log)

*This file contains the dynamic state, embedded rules, active plan, and log for the current session.*
*It is read and updated frequently by the AI during its operational loop.*

---

## State

*Holds the current status of the workflow.*

```yaml
Phase: VALIDATE # Current workflow phase (ANALYZE, BLUEPRINT, CONSTRUCT, VALIDATE, BLUEPRINT_REVISE)
Status: COMPLETED # Current status (READY, IN_PROGRESS, BLOCKED_*, NEEDS_*, COMPLETED)
CurrentTaskID: analyze_sentiment_feature # Identifier for the main task being worked on
CurrentStep: null # Identifier for the specific step in the plan being executed
```

---

## Plan

*Contains the step-by-step implementation plan generated during the BLUEPRINT phase.*

`[x] Step 1: Update the Body.tsx component to implement sentiment analysis`
  - Add import for analyzeConversationSentiment function
  - Add import for ConversationSentiment component
  - Add state for the conversation sentiment
  - Add useEffect hook to analyze messages when they change
  - Add conditional rendering of ConversationSentiment component

`[x] Step 2: Verify that the ConversationSentiment component correctly displays the sentiment data`
  - Check styling and positioning
  - Ensure proper sentiment data is passed to the component

`[x] Step 3: Add a toggle feature to show/hide sentiment analysis (optional enhancement)`
  - Add state for toggling sentiment visibility
  - Add toggle button in the header or body
  - Add conditional rendering based on toggle state

`[x] Step 4: Test the feature with different message types and sentiment patterns`
  - Test with positive messages
  - Test with negative messages
  - Test with neutral messages
  - Test with mixed sentiment messages

`[x] Step 5: Add proper error handling for the sentiment analysis`
  - Add try/catch blocks around sentiment analysis
  - Add fallback UI for error cases
  - Ensure performance is maintained with large message sets

## Rules

*Embedded rules governing the AI's autonomous operation.*

**# --- Core Workflow Rules ---**

RULE_WF_PHASE_ANALYZE:
  **Constraint:** Goal is understanding request/context. NO solutioning or implementation planning.

RULE_WF_PHASE_BLUEPRINT:
  **Constraint:** Goal is creating a detailed, unambiguous step-by-step plan. NO code implementation.

RULE_WF_PHASE_CONSTRUCT:
  **Constraint:** Goal is executing the `## Plan` exactly. NO deviation. If issues arise, trigger error handling or revert phase.

RULE_WF_PHASE_VALIDATE:
  **Constraint:** Goal is verifying implementation against `## Plan` and requirements using tools. NO new implementation.

RULE_WF_TRANSITION_01:
  **Trigger:** Explicit user command (`@analyze`, `@blueprint`, `@construct`, `@validate`).
  **Action:** Update `State.Phase` accordingly. Log phase change.

RULE_WF_TRANSITION_02:
  **Trigger:** AI determines current phase constraint prevents fulfilling user request OR error handling dictates phase change (e.g., RULE_ERR_HANDLE_TEST_01).
  **Action:** Log the reason. Update `State.Phase` (e.g., to `BLUEPRINT_REVISE`). Set `State.Status` appropriately (e.g., `NEEDS_PLAN_APPROVAL`). Report to user.

**# --- Initialization & Resumption Rules ---**

RULE_INIT_01:
  **Trigger:** AI session/task starts AND `workflow_state.md` is missing or empty.
  **Action:**
    1. Create `workflow_state.md` with default structure.
    2. Read `project_config.md` (prompt user if missing).
    3. Set `State.Phase = ANALYZE`, `State.Status = READY`.
    4. Log "Initialized new session."
    5. Prompt user for the first task.

RULE_INIT_02:
  **Trigger:** AI session/task starts AND `workflow_state.md` exists.
  **Action:**
    1. Read `project_config.md`.
    2. Read existing `workflow_state.md`.
    3. Log "Resumed session."
    4. Check `State.Status`: Handle READY, COMPLETED, BLOCKED_*, NEEDS_*, IN_PROGRESS appropriately (prompt user or report status).

RULE_INIT_03:
  **Trigger:** User confirms continuation via RULE_INIT_02 (for IN_PROGRESS state).
  **Action:** Proceed with the next action based on loaded state and rules.

**# --- Memory Management Rules ---**

RULE_MEM_READ_LTM_01:
  **Trigger:** Start of a new major task or phase.
  **Action:** Read `project_config.md`. Log action.

RULE_MEM_READ_STM_01:
  **Trigger:** Before *every* decision/action cycle.
  **Action:** Read `workflow_state.md`.

RULE_MEM_UPDATE_STM_01:
  **Trigger:** After *every* significant action or information receipt.
  **Action:** Immediately update relevant sections (`## State`, `## Plan`, `## Log`) in `workflow_state.md` and save.

RULE_MEM_UPDATE_LTM_01:
  **Trigger:** User command (`@config/update`) OR end of successful VALIDATE phase for significant change.
  **Action:** Propose concise updates to `project_config.md` based on `## Log`/diffs. Set `State.Status = NEEDS_LTM_APPROVAL`. Await user confirmation.

RULE_MEM_VALIDATE_01:
  **Trigger:** After updating `workflow_state.md` or `project_config.md`.
  **Action:** Perform internal consistency check. If issues found, log and set `State.Status = NEEDS_CLARIFICATION`.

**# --- Tool Integration Rules (Cursor Environment) ---**

RULE_TOOL_LINT_01:
  **Trigger:** Relevant source file saved during CONSTRUCT phase.
  **Action:** Instruct Cursor terminal to run lint command. Log attempt. On completion, parse output, log result, set `State.Status = BLOCKED_LINT` if errors.

RULE_TOOL_FORMAT_01:
  **Trigger:** Relevant source file saved during CONSTRUCT phase.
  **Action:** Instruct Cursor to apply formatter or run format command via terminal. Log attempt.

RULE_TOOL_TEST_RUN_01:
  **Trigger:** Command `@validate` or entering VALIDATE phase.
  **Action:** Instruct Cursor terminal to run test suite. Log attempt. On completion, parse output, log result, set `State.Status = BLOCKED_TEST` if failures, `TESTS_PASSED` if success.

RULE_TOOL_APPLY_CODE_01:
  **Trigger:** AI determines code change needed per `## Plan` during CONSTRUCT phase.
  **Action:** Generate modification. Instruct Cursor to apply it. Log action.

**# --- Error Handling & Recovery Rules ---**

RULE_ERR_HANDLE_LINT_01:
  **Trigger:** `State.Status` is `BLOCKED_LINT`.
  **Action:** Analyze error in `## Log`. Attempt auto-fix if simple/confident. Apply fix via RULE_TOOL_APPLY_CODE_01. Re-run lint via RULE_TOOL_LINT_01. If success, reset `State.Status`. If fail/complex, set `State.Status = BLOCKED_LINT_UNRESOLVED`, report to user.

RULE_ERR_HANDLE_TEST_01:
  **Trigger:** `State.Status` is `BLOCKED_TEST`.
  **Action:** Analyze failure in `## Log`. Attempt auto-fix if simple/localized/confident. Apply fix via RULE_TOOL_APPLY_CODE_01. Re-run failed test(s) or suite via RULE_TOOL_TEST_RUN_01. If success, reset `State.Status`. If fail/complex, set `State.Phase = BLUEPRINT_REVISE`, `State.Status = NEEDS_PLAN_APPROVAL`, propose revised `## Plan` based on failure analysis, report to user.

RULE_ERR_HANDLE_GENERAL_01:
  **Trigger:** Unexpected error or ambiguity.
  **Action:** Log error/situation to `## Log`. Set `State.Status = BLOCKED_UNKNOWN`. Report to user, request instructions.
